## About
Ruddock House is one of the eight undergraduate student houses in the housing system at Caltech. Ruddock was founded in 1960 in honor of Albert Billings Ruddock, a former Chairman of the Caltech Board of Trustees. Some notable alumni from Ruddock House include Peter Shor, Bill Gross, Eric Betzig, and Michael Rosbash. The current house motto is *Virtutis mammilas exsugimus.*

This is a 1.5" diameter PCB keychain emblazoned with the Ruddock House crest on the top copper and on the botom silkscreen.
